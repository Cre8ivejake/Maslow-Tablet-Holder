My tablet holder was made with 3/4 inch plywood and held together with one inch screws.

The tablet it is designed to hold is [this RCA Cambio](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0188MSALC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). I wouldn't recommend buying that exact one because there are chaper and newer versions available now, but it does work well.
